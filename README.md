# deep-dive

This repository is focused on takeing molecular data from three experiments where integrated epigenetic analysis has already been performed, and doing a _deeper dive_ into datasets to extract and analyze remaining points of excitement. 


In brief some extra special data sets that will be generated

### Epigenetic Data Types
- CpG methylation
- long non-coding RNA
- Gene Methylation Modules

### Gene Activity
- Transcript expression
- Gene Coeff Var
- Transcript Coeff Variation
- Predominat isoform
- Gene Expression Modules

### Other
