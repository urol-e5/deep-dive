Bismark + was done on Hyak.

Genmome stats

```{r}
kt <- read.csv("../data/Pver-karytotype.tab", header = FALSE, sep = "\t")
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(kt))
```

There are `r nrow(kt)` scaffolds

```{r}
nrow(kt)
```

```{r}
ggplot(kt, aes(x = V2)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100) +
  scale_x_log10()
```

```{r, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(kt, aes(x = V2)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100) +
  xlim(0, 5000)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(kt %>% filter(V2 < 1000) %>% count())
```

First thing I want to do is do a simple histogram showing distribution of methylation levels. This will likely be done by taking 10 bedgraphs and concatenating then, making a histogram.

After that I would want to look at distribution across features..
