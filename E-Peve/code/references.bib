  abstract = "Quantitative and systems biology approaches benefit from the
              unprecedented depth of next-generation sequencing. A typical
              experiment yields millions of short reads, which oftentimes carry
              particular sequence tags. These tags may be: (a) specific to the
              sequencing platform and library construction method (e.g.,
              adapter sequences); (b) have been introduced by experimental
              design (e.g., sample barcodes); or (c) constitute some biological
              signal (e.g., splice leader sequences in nematodes). Our software
              FLEXBAR enables accurate recognition, sorting and trimming of
              sequence tags with maximal flexibility, based on exact overlap
              sequence alignment. The software supports data formats from all
              current sequencing platforms, including color-space reads.
              FLEXBAR maintains read pairings and processes separate barcode
              reads on demand. Our software facilitates the fine-grained
              adjustment of sequence tag detection parameters and search
              regions. FLEXBAR is a multi-threaded software and combines speed
              with precision. Even complex read processing scenarios might be
              executed with a single command line call. We demonstrate the
              utility of the software in terms of read mapping applications,
              library demultiplexing and splice leader detection. FLEXBAR and
              additional information is available for academic use from the
              website: http://sourceforge.net/projects/flexbar/.",

  author   = "Roehr, Johannes T and Dieterich, Christoph and Reinert, Knut",
  abstract = "MOTIVATION: High-throughput sequencing machines can process many
              samples in a single run. For Illumina systems, sequencing reads
              are barcoded with an additional DNA tag that is contained in the
              respective sequencing adapters. The recognition of barcode and
              adapter sequences is hence commonly needed for the analysis of
              next-generation sequencing data. Flexbar performs demultiplexing
              based on barcodes and adapter trimming for such data. The massive
              amounts of data generated on modern sequencing machines demand
              that this preprocessing is done as efficiently as possible.
              RESULTS: We present Flexbar 3.0, the successor of the popular
              program Flexbar. It employs now twofold parallelism:
              multi-threading and additionally SIMD vectorization. Both types
              of parallelism are used to speed-up the computation of pair-wise
              sequence alignments, which are used for the detection of barcodes
              and adapters. Furthermore, new features were included to cover a
              wide range of applications. We evaluated the performance of
              Flexbar based on a simulated sequencing dataset. Our program
              outcompetes other tools in terms of speed and is among the best
              tools in the presented quality benchmark. AVAILABILITY AND
