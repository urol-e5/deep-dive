This code will investigate the proximity of ncRNAs to other genomic features. The `bash` code snippets were done on the URI HPC server, Andromeda 


## miRNAs







```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
```

Load Ptuh bed file into R. 
```{r}
bed <- read.delim("../output/19-bedtools-closest/filtered_Ptuh_output_overlap.bed", header = F)
```
