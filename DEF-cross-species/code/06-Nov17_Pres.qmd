## Non-coding RNA 

Where things stand

## lncRNA Discovery

- Aligned RNA-seq reads to genome -> SAM files
- SAM files converted to BAMS
- BAMS converted to GTF (Stringtie), merged to single GTF
- ID non-coding transcripts (GFFCompare, CPC2)
- Fasta and Bed file created for each species


## lncRNA by the numbers

- Apul total transcripts / lncRNA = 106174 /
